# MVC-Assignment-Tracker
- MVC Assignment Tracker is a web application project that I created to learn the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern. This project is designed to help teachers keep track of assignments.
- The application is built using the MVC architecture pattern, which separates the application's concerns into three distinct components: the model, the view, and the controller. This separation allows for easier maintenance and development, as well as more flexible and modular code.
- The model component of the application is responsible for managing the data and business logic. In this case, the model stores information about assignments and courses.
- The view component is responsible for displaying the data to the user. In MVC Assignment Tracker, the view consists of a clean, user-friendly interface that allows teachers to view and manage assignments.
- The controller component is responsible for managing the interactions between the model and the view. It includes functions for updating the model based on user input, and for updating the view based on changes to the model.
